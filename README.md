# dbv - Database visualizer

`dbv` is a tool to visualize database schema, execute query etc.

## Technical thought - only for me

- on every action, add text to log output (through store)
- add selection on connection list

- only allow selection on other pnae if previous is selected : if no db selected, no table etc.
