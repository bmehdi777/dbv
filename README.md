# dbv - Database visualizer

`dbv` is a tool to visualize database schema, execute query etc.

## Technical thought - only for me

- on every action, add text to log output (through store)
- add selection on connection list

- only allow selection on other pane if previous is selected : if no db selected, no table etc.

- add a pane "are you sure?y/N" when deleting/droping db/droping database
- add a pane to add a connection : multiple input to register name + connection string
- register user preferences to a file and restore it on launch (store)
